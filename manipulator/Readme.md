# Installation instructions

You can run the Jupyter notebook for the project using a local installation of Python on your computer. Please reach out as soon as possible if you have issues doing this.

You will need to have a local installation of Python (>3.7 recommended). We recommend that you install Python using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

You then will need to install 
1. [Pybullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/), which is the simulator

With an Anaconda installation, you can run the following:
``conda install pybullet``

With pip you can install it with
``pip install pybullet``

Or refer to the installation instruction on the Pybullet website.

Your environment should then be all set to run the Notebook.
